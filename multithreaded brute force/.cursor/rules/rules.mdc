# Strict Coding Standards

## Main Rules

1. **Never delete or modify existing working functionality** unless it is explicitly required by the technical specification (TS).
2. **Do not write temporary, demo, or placeholder functions.** Always provide complete, production-ready implementations.
3. **Do not add comments suggesting future rewrites or improvements** (e.g., "this is a demo function, should be rewritten later").
4. **Strictly follow the technical specification.** Do not improvise, guess, or add anything not clearly required.
5. **Avoid unnecessary changes** to already working code.
6. **Respect and follow the existing architecture and code style** of the project.
7. **Ensure proper integration with the existing codebase.** Do not create isolated stubs or mockups.
8. **Do not propose alternative solutions** unless explicitly requested by the technical specification.
9. **All responses, comments must be written in Russian.**
10. **Make sure new code does not break existing functionality** before finalizing the changes.

## Notes

- The main priorities are stability, cleanliness, and production readiness.
- These rules are mandatory and must be followed by the AI in all tasks.
- They help maintain high code quality, reliability, and consistency.
